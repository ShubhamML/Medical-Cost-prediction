In this project, my main aim is to show ways to go deep into the data story-telling even though the dataset is small. Also, we will work on a model that could give us an approximation as to what will be the charges of the patients. Nevertheless, we must go deeply into what factors influenced the charge of a specific patient. In order to do this we must look for patterns in our data analysis and gain extensive insight of what the data is telling us. Lastly, we will go step by step to understand the story behind the patients in this dataset only through this way we could have a better understanding of what features will help our model have a closer accuracy to the true patient charge.
